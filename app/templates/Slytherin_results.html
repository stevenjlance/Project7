    <center><h1>Slytherin Characteristics</h1></center>
    <p>Slytherin produces more than its share of Dark wizards, but also turns out leaders who are proud, ambitious and cunning.</p>
    <p>Slytherins tend to be ambitious, shrewd, cunning, strong leaders, and achievement-oriented. They also have highly developed senses of self-preservation.This means that Slytherins tend to hesitate before acting, so as to weigh all possible outcomes before deciding exactly what should be done. Slytherins are associated with cunning, ambition and a tendency to look after their own. Slytherin has produced its share of Dark witches and wizards, but members are not afraid to admit it. Slytherins are always striving to be the best, something they have in common with Ravenclaws. However, Slytherins will never leave their own behind.</p>
